              This privacy policy governs your use of the software application <em>Field A.I.R.</em> (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by <em>Younility Inc.</em> The Application is designed to allow updating of the Ericsson Adaptive Inventory (EAI) system in real time. Field A.I.R. focuses on the field by permitting real time data collection using mobile devices and the Field A.I.R. Application. Tasks can be sent directly from EAI to field technicians, allowing them to audit information and return it to EAI. Built in maps and turn-by-turn directions allow field technicians to navigate to their work sites. Attachments allow field users or admin users to attach photos and files to send between dispatch and the field. A wide range of information can be sent to the field for verification or information purposes.
              <br />
              <br />
              Field A.I.R. is comprised of three main components: the Younility Application Program Interface (API), the Field A.I.R. Bridge and the Field A.I.R. mobile Application. Together they form the full solution, able to translate data collection requests and generate task requests from EAI to the field technician.
